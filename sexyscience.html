    <div class="content words">I am no scientist. When I did honors physics in high school, I made a very average bamboo trebuchet with my mom and, unbelievably, an even less successful mousetrap-powered car with my dad. And yet, my scientific misadventures have not deterred my love of science. And while I cannot truly explain Schrödinger's cat, as my friends will attest to, I will continue to pervade the field with my participation and commitment to the pursuit of knowledge.
<br/><br/>
These experiments are my illustrative response to the field of sexy science. They are not controlled. They are not, quote my flatmate, “very scientific”. They are here as a learning tool for those of us with brains perhaps more oriented towards the creative, or those who want a little more of a hands-on approach to science. (or maybe you just like to mouseover things to see what happens; I’m like that)
<br/><br/>
These trials may follow the studies upon which they are based, or they may completely flop. Such is the joy of testing things on the internet’s commonwealth without parameters.
