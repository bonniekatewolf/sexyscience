					I am no scientist. When I did honors physics in high school, 
					I made a very average bamboo trebuchet with my mom and, 
					unbelievably, an even less successful mousetrap-powered car with 
					my dad. And yet, my scientific misadventures have not deterred my 
					love of science. And while I cannot truly explain Schrödinger's cat, 
					as my friends will attest to, I will continue to pervade the field with 
					my participation and commitment to the pursuit of knowledge.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					These experiments are my illustrative response to the field of sexy 
					science. They are not controlled. They are not, quote my flatmate, 
					“very scientific”. They are here as a learning tool for those of us 
					with brains perhaps more oriented towards the creative, or those who want 
					a little more of a hands-on approach to science. (or maybe you just like to 
					mouseover things to see what happens; I’m like that)
					<br/>
					<br/>
					These trials may follow the studies upon which they are based, or they may 
					completely flop. Such is the joy of testing things on the internet’s 
					commonwealth without parameters.
